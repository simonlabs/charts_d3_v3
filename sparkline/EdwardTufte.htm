typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer 
cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather 
sparkline graphic can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in
a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic. From Edward 
Tufte's book <i>Beautiful Evidence</i>.</p>

<i>New developments in sparklines: November 2013.</i>

<b><i>Diluting Perceptual Cluster/Streak Bias: 
<br>Informal, Inline, Interocular Trauma Tests</i></b>
<br></p><p>
When people look at random number tables, they sees all kinds of clusters 
<br>and streaks (in a completely random set of data). Similarly, when people are 
<br>asked generate a random series of bits, they generate too few long streaks 
<br>(such as 6 identical bits a row), because their model of what is random 
<br>greatly underestimates the amount of streakiness in truly random data.
<br></p>

<p>
To dilute streak-guessing, randomize on time over the same data, 
<br>and compare random streaks with the observed data. 
<br>Below, the top sparkline shows the season's win-loss sequence 
<br>(the little horizontal line = home games, no line = road games). 
<br>Weighting by overall record of wins/losses and home/road effects 
<br>yields ten random sparklines. Hard to see the difference between 
<br>real and random.</p><p>

The 10 random sparkline sequences can be regenerated again and 
<br>again by, oddly enough, clicking on "Regenerate random seasons."
<br>This is looking a bit like bootstrap calculation. For the real and amazing 
<br>bootstrap, applied to data graphics and contour lines, see Persi Diaconis 
<br>and Bradley Efron, <a target="_blank" href="http://statistics.stanford.edu/%7Eckirby/techreports/BIO/BIO%2083.pdf">"Computer Intensive Methods in Statistics."</a>
<br></p><p>The test of the 10 randomized sparklines vs. the actual data is an 
<br>"Interocular Trauma Test" because the comparison hits the analyst right 
<br>between the eyes. This little randomization check-up, which can be repeated 
<br>again and again, is seen by the analyst at the very moment of making 
<br>inferences based on a statistical graphic of observed data.

<p>
<br>
<br>
The most common data display is a noun accompanied by a number.<br>
For example, a medical patient's current level of glucose is reported<br>
in a clinical record as a word and number:
<br>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-1073.gif" border="0" height="54" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>

Placed in the relevant context, a single number gains meaning. Thus<br>
the most recent measurement of glucose should be compared with<br>
earlier measurements for the patient. This data-line shows the path<br>
of the last 80 readings of glucose:
<br>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-1075.gif" border="0" height="57" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>

Lacking a scale of measurement, this free-floating line is dequantified.<br>
At least we do know the value of the line's right-most data point,<br>
which corresponds to the most recent value of glucose, the number<br>
recorded at far right. Both representations of the most recent reading<br>
are tied together with a color accent:
<br>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-1077.gif" border="0" height="57" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>

Some useful context is provided by showing the <i>normal range</i> of<br>
glucose, here as a gray band. Compared to normal limits, readings<br>
above the band horizon are elevated, those below reduced:
<br>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-1080.gif" border="0" height="59" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>

For clinical analysis, the task is to detect quickly and assess wayward<br>
deviations from normal limits, shown here by visual deviations outside<br>
the gray band. Multiplying this format brings in additional data from<br>
the medical record; a stack, which can show hundreds of variables and<br>
thousands of measurements, allows fast effective parallel comparisons:
<br>

    <table align="center" border="0">

        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-1065.gif" border="0" height="104" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>

These little data lines, because of their active quality over time, are<br>
named <i>sparklines</i>—small, high-resolution graphics usually embedded<br>
in a full context of words, numbers, images. Sparklines are <i>datawords:</i><br>
data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparklines and sparkline-like graphs can also move within complex<br>
multivariate spaces, as in these 9-step sequential results (reading down<br>
the columns) in merge-sorting 5 different types of input files. Four<br>
variables and 18,000 numbers are depicted in these small multiples.

Sparklines have obvious applications for financial and economic data—<br>
by tracking and comparing changes over time, by showing overall trend<br>
along with local detail. Embedded in a data table, this sparkline depicts<br>
an exchange rate (dollar cost of one euro) for every day for one year:
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15655.gif" border="0" height="75" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
<br>
Colors help link the sparkline with the numbers: <font color="red">red</font> = the oldest and<br>
newest rates in the series; <font color="blue">blue</font> = yearly low and high for daily exchange<br>
rates. Extending this graphic table is straightforward; here, the price of<br>
the euro versus 3 other currencies for 65 months and for 12 months:
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15656.gif" border="0" height="119" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
<br>
Daily sparkline data can be standardized and scaled in all sorts of ways<br>
depending on the content: by the range of the price, inflation-adjusted<br>
price, percent change, percent change off of a market baseline. Thus<br>
<i>multiple sparklines</i> can describe the same noun, just as multiple columns<br>
of numbers report various measures of performance. These sparklines<br>
reveal the details of the most recent 12 months in the context of a<br>
65-month daily sequence (shown in the fractal-like structure below).
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15658.gif" border="0" height="122" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consuming a horizontal length of only 14 letterspaces, each sparkline<br>
in the big table above provides a look at the price and the changes in<br>
price for every day for years, and the overall time pattern. <i>This financial<br>
table reports 24 numbers accurate to 5 significant digits; the accompanying<br>
sparklines show about 14,000 numbers readable from 1 to 2 significant digits.<br>
The idea is to be approximately right rather than exactly wrong.</i>&nbsp;<font size="-1">1</font>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By showing recent change in relation to many past changes, sparklines<br>
provide a context for nuanced analysis—and, one hopes, better decisions.<br>
Moreover, the year-long daily history reduces <i>recency bias,</i> the persistent<br>
and widespread over-weighting of recent events in making decisions.<br>
Tables sometimes reinforce recency bias by showing only current levels<br>
or recent changes; sparklines improve the attention span of tables.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables of numbers attain maximum densities of only 300 characters per<br>
square inch or 50 characters per square centimeter. In contrast, graphical<br>
displays have far greater resolutions; a cartographer notes "the resolving<br>
power of the eye enables it to differentiate to 0.1 mm where provoked to<br>
do so."&nbsp;<font size="-1">2</font> &nbsp;Distinctions at 0.1 mm mean 250 per linear inch, which implies<br>
60,000 per square inch or 10,000 per square centimeter, which is plenty.

This is a common display in data analysis: a list of nouns (mutual funds,<br>
for example) along with some numbers (assets, changes) that accompany<br>
the nouns. The analyst's job is to look over the data matrix and then decide<br>
whether or not to go crazy—or at least to make a decision (buy, sell, hold)<br>
about the noun based on the data. But along with the summary clumps<br>
of tabular data, let us also look at the day-to-day path of prices and their<br>
changes for the entire last year. Here is the sparkline table:&nbsp;<font size="-1">4</font>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Astonishing and disconcerting, the finely detailed similarities of these<br>
daily sparkline histories are not all that surprising, after the fact anyway.<br>
Several funds use market index-tracking or other copycat strategies, and<br>
all the funds are driven daily by the same amalgam of external forces<br>
(news, fads, economic policies, panics, bubbles). Of the 10 funds, only<br>
the unfortunately named PIMCO, the sole bond fund in the table, diverges<br>
from the common pattern of the 9 stock funds, as seen by comparing<br>
PIMCO's sparkline with the stacked pile of 9 other sparklines below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In newspaper financial tables, down the deep columns of numbers,<br>
sparklines can be added to tables set at 8 lines per inch (as in our example<br>
above). This yields about 160 sparklines per column, or <i>400,000 additional<br>
daily graphical prices and their changes</i> per 5-column financial page. Readers<br>
can scan the sparkline tables, making simultaneous multiple comparisons,<br>
searching for nonrandom patterns in the random walks of prices.

4&nbsp;&nbsp;In our redesigned table, the typeface Gill Sans does quite well<br>
compared to the Helvetica in the original <i>Times</i> table. Smaller than<br>
the Helvetica, the Gill Sans appears sturdier and more readable, in<br>
part because of the increased white space that results from its<br>
smaller x-height and reduced size. The data area (without column<br>
labels) for our sparkline table is only 21% larger than the original's<br>
data area, and yet the sparklines provide an approximate look at<br>
5,000 more numbers.</font>
</p><p>
<br><br>
Finally, the practical construction of sparklines requires thinking<br>
about their design and production: 
<br>
<br>
<i>Aspect ratio</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graphic's width/height ratio makes a big difference in<br>
displaying data. For <i>all</i> types of statistical graphics, the data-shape varies<br>
as the aspect ratio varies. Below, for 6 sparklines all showing the same<br>
data, note the substantial changes in shape as the y-scale increases by 25%<br>
for each line while the x-scale is held constant.<br>

      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
How should a sparkline aspect ratio be chosen? Like a narrow ribbon, sparklines<br>
have one long dimension and one short, as their wordlike shapes constrain their<br>
aspect ratios. This financial sparkline is 5 to 1:

the DNA chromosome sparklines run about 300 to 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, statistical graphics should be moderately greater in length<br>
than in height. And, as William Cleveland discovered, for judging slopes<br>
and velocities up and down the hills in time-series, best is an aspect ratio<br>
that yields hill-slopes averaging 45°, over every cycle in the time-series.<br>
Variations in slopes are best detected when the slopes are around 45°,<br>
uphill or downhill.&nbsp;<font size="-1">5</font> To put this idea informally, aspect ratios should<br>
be such that time-series graphics tend toward a <i>lumpy</i> profile (below left)<br>
rather than a spiky profile (below right) or a flat profile. Both graphs<br>
here show the same data. The aspect ratio for this lumpy graphic is<br>
chosen in accord with the 45° rule.
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15828.gif" border="0" height="253" width="950"></td>

    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The lumpy graphic reveals that sunspot cycles tend to rise rapidly and<br>
decline slowly, a behavior strongest for cycles with high sharp peaks, less<br>
strong for medium peaks, and absent for cycles with small low peaks.<br>
None of this is visible in the graph of spikes! Cleveland's idea is essential<br>
for sparkline displays of high-resolution time-series, such as in acoustics,<br>
medicine, science, engineering, finance. For multiple sparklines, as in the<br>
mutual fund data below, a global aspect ratio is obtained by averaging<br>
over the relevant data-lines to yield an overall lumpy quality.

    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations yield practical advice for choosing aspect ratios for<br>
sparklines: use the <i>maximum</i> reasonable vertical space available under the<br>
word-like constraint, then adjust the horizontal stretch of the time-scale<br>
to meet the lumpy criterion. Occasionally the analytical task or character<br>
of the data may suggest a better alternative.

<i>Unintentional optical clutter</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above left, these binary-outcome sparklines<br>
mainly show accidental arrangements of white space rather than binary<br>
outcomes. Then, above right, a less cluttered version of the same data.<br>
Closely spaced lines produce moiré vibration, usually at its worst when<br>
data-lines (the figure) and spaces (the ground) between data-lines are<br>
approximately equal in size, and also when figure and ground contrast<br>
strongly in color value. The result is hyperactive optical clutter—for<br>
example, below. In contrast, note the serene and cleanly differentiated<br>
lines on this spring's new bamboo culm to the right.

      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the relative weight of the data-lines and also muting the<br>
contrast between data and background reduces optical noise, as these<br>
before/after designs of sparklines suggest:
<br>

</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard method for printing color (4-color process) sometimes<br>
produces unintentional noise when printing finely detailed material,<br>
such as type and sparklines. In 4-color printing (cyan, magenta, yellow,<br>
black), tiny dots of color mix together to make the desired color (for<br>
example, cyan dots + yellow dots = apparent green). These color dots do<br>
not align perfectly, and both type and thin lines can become gritty when<br>
printed by conventional 4-color process, shown below.
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15840.gif" border="0" height="98" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
High-quality maps avoid color dot combinations, as a close look at the<br>
Swiss mountain map will indicate. Sparklines should be printed in a single<br>
color, or by a judicious mix of 2 colors (magenta + yellow = red), or in flat<br>
color (the ink itself is the desired color), or by stochastic color methods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas surrounding data-lines may generate unintentional optical<br>
clutter. Strong frames produce melodramatic but content-diminishing<br>
visual effects. At left, the dominant visual elements are, of all things,<br>
the strong stripes of the negative spaces between the heavy frames:
<br>

    <table align="left" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0001OS-15841.gif" border="0" height="90" width="950"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
A good way to assess a display for unintentional optical clutter is to ask<br>
"Do the prominent visual effects convey relevant content?" In the<br>
exhibits above earning the unfortunate <font color="red">X</font>, the most prominent visual<br>
effect is usually the clutter produced by activated negative space.<br>
</p><p>
<br><br>

<i>Resolution of sparklines</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparklines work at intense resolutions, at the level<br>
of good typography and cartography. Currently such intensities can be<br>
found only on paper, film, and metal—where resolutions &gt;1,200 dpi<br>
are easily and inexpensively achieved. Today's computer monitors operate<br>
at about 10% of paper's resolution, producing coarse typography in the<br>
smaller point sizes as well as sparklines lacking in fine detail. Of course<br>
sparklines can be displayed on computer screens but for serious work,<br>
sparklines should be printed on paper. Combining paper's resolution<br>
with the computer screen's interactivity is often effective.<br>
</p><p>
<i>Resolution of layouts of multiple sparklines</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For monitoring processes that<br>
produce lots of data (financial trading, sporting events, control rooms,<br>
scientific and medical analysis, system administration), sparklines should<br>
be printed and viewed at a density of 500 sparklines on A3 size paper<br>
(about 25 x 45 cm, or 11 x 17 in). This is the data-equivalent of about 15<br>
large computer screens or 300 PowerPoint slides. Unlike relentlessly<br>
sequential screens and slides, 500 sparklines on a large piece of paper are<br>
<i>adjacent in space</i> rather than <i>stacked in time</i>. By showing vast amounts<br>
of data within the eyespan, spatial adjacency assists comparison, search,<br>
pattern-finding, exploration, replication, review.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as sparklines are like <i>words</i>, so then distributions of sparklines on<br>
a page are like <i>sentences and paragraphs</i>. The graphical idea here is <i>make<br>
it wordlike and typographic</i>—an idea that leads to reasonable answers for<br>
most questions about sparkline arrangements.<br>
</p><p>
Imagine new software or a new computer display that enormously<br>
improved the resolution of data graphics. How wonderful and valuable<br>
that would be. Sparklines provide such improvements <i>by design</i>, by<br>
direct, public, open-source methods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparklines vastly increase the amount of data within our eyespan and<br>
intensify statistical graphics up to the everyday routine capabilities of<br>
the human eye-brain system for reasoning about visual evidence, seeing<br>
distinctions, and making comparisons. And data graphics are no longer<br>
a special occasion in a separate place with a frame on some slide with a<br>
label "Fig. 17-B". Sparklines are everywhere. With resolutions 5 to 100<br>
times conventional graphics and tables, sparklines can help us learn from<br>
the flood of numbers produced by modern measurement, monitoring,<br>
and surveillance technologies. Providing a straightforward and contextual<br>
look at intense evidence, sparkline graphics give us some chance to be<br>
approximately right rather than exactly wrong.<br>

you could show at least 100 numbers in the space that now shows 1

</p><p> </p><p>Plotting arctan(<i>x/x</i><sub>0</sub>) instead of <i>x</i> is very effective for stabilizing residual plots with outliers. If the scaling factor <i>x</i><sub>0</sub> is chosen so that non-outlier values of <i>x/x</i><sub>0</sub>
 fall in the range -0.6 to 0.6 then the arctan is within 10% of the  
unscaled value (close enough to pass unnoticed in a residual plot), but 
outliers, no matter how large, remain plottable, but still recognizable 
as outliers. In practice, even if outliers are present one can still, 
for example, recognize a systematic trend among the non-outliers.

		<p><i>Interpretation of  transformed variables in regression equations</i>
</p><p>Some transformations have reasonable interpretations, some don't.
 In the 2-variable case, log Y on X, Y on log X, and log Y on log X, the
 resulting slopes have clear substantive interpretations with regard to 
the XY relationship. Log Y on log X is particularly helpful since the 
resulting slope is the elasticity of Y in relation to X. Similarly for Y
 on 1/X, or for log odds Y on log odds X. (More details in my Data 
Analysis for Politics and Policy, pp. 108-131.)</p><p></p><p>But for Y 
on arctan X, what does it mean to a reseacher to say that a unit change 
in arctan X is associated with a corresponding estimated slope change in
 Y? Thus optimizing the statistical properties of univariate 
distributions, usually by transforming them into a normal distribution, 
may at the same time be denying straightforward substantive 
interpretations of bivariate or multivariate relationships. Peculiar 
transforms useful for statistical courtesy seem contrary to nature. That
 is, there are probably no laws of nature where Y varies in proportion 
to arctan X (an assertion I may regret). </p><p></p><p>In the case of 
sparklines, Y transforms should make sense in terms of the velocities up
 and down the time-series. Time-scales can also be transformed, for 
example, to estimate doubling-times (try logs to the base 2 of time).</p><p></p><p>I
 was recently looking at some regressions of art auction prices on time;
 the researcher included 5 powers of time (t, t-squared, t-cubed, t to 
the fourth, and t to the fifth) in the multiple regression, resulting in
 the ludicrous situation of figuring out, say, the meaning of a cubic 
year, a unit change in cubic year, and how that relates to changes in 
price. Little drawings of square years and cubic years didn't help. And 
drawings were impossible for the hyperspace time scales. Yes, the 
researcher was looking for turns in prices over time, but the exercise 
had by then turned into mindless curve-fitting.

</p><p> We've incorporated the idea of sparklines into a new project 
that we thought might be of interest to readers of this thread.

Data visualizations of Google's massive news aggregator seem like an 
interesting way to graphically keep tabs on developing news stories.

We've built an In The News visualizer which provides a visual reference 
for Google's "In The News" sidebar (seen at <a target="_blank" href="http://news.google.com/">news.google.com</a>),
 providing an archive of popular news items, links to headlines, and a 
method for comparing news item performance over time. We think this is 
going to be increasingly interesting as the US election season 
progresses, and stories about world events erupt and subside.

The interface can be refocused on specific names, and groups of items 
can be compared over time using sparkline graphs.

</p><p> </p><p>Nonetheless, Mariano Belinsky's example is most 
impressive -- not necessarily as a way of integrating graphs into text, 
but as a way of packing a tremendous amount of intelligible information 
into a small space. Even printed at high resolution on paper there are 
few examples that get as much information into a small space as he does,
 but on a computer screen I have rarely seen anything approaching it. By
 my estimate he has 90000 pixels for the 15 stocks shown on his web 
site, or 6000 per graph, yet one can easily see what each graph is doing
 and where any sudden changes occurred. The use of colour is nice, as 
well, though not entirely logical: red is used for stocks that fall and 
also for the yearly low, which is fair enough; but the implied logic is 
not carried over to the stocks that rise and the yearly high, which are 
blue and green respectively. 
 
</p><p>I'm not too worried about the lack of a scale for the <i>x</i> 
axis, because it's not too difficult to mentally break up a year into 
months. However, it might be possible to use vertical white lines to 
mark off months, or, if that was too noticeable, quarters. Somewhere, 
however, either in the text or on the graph itself, there ought to be a 
clear indication of what the time period is. 
 
</p><p>I am not at all keen on abbreviations. No, that puts it too 
weakly: I absolutely detest avoidable abbreviations, especially if they 
aren't guessable. I can guess what AMZN and MSFT are, and maybe AA, but 
most of the others suggest nothing at all. With slightly smaller type 
(and mixed upper- and lower-case) one could use much more obvious 
labels: "Amazon" takes barely more space than "AMZN", and even though 
"Microsoft" is appreciably longer than "MSFT" there would be room for 
it. 
 
</p><p>In my field (biochemistry) I argue about this all the time with 
people who try to insist that (for example) "everybody knows" that LADH 
is liver alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH is reduced nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide. The problem, however, is that not everyone who reads any 
given text is expert enough to know what "everybody knows".

<p>By combining data and icon, the name communicates the idea of packaging information in a <i>small</i>

of an entire line of text, not just a single word). It also dodges the

 there were only six hits, and they were all in Italian. That leaves you
 free to define the word without worrying about competing meanings that

<p>One possible fly in the ointment: dat<strong style="color: #F00;">a</strong>cons (with an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’) generates <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=datacons">a lot of hits on google</a>, including a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datacons.com/">company</a> by that name.</p>

</p><p>The suggestion concerning scaling the representations to have 
approximately a 45 degree angle of change as a cue to the velocity of 
change suggests two ideas: </p><p></p><p>  First, that is the point at 
which the sine function is at its greatest rate of change, providing 
some small justification for that suggestion;  the eye is more able to 
detect the pattern of change, because the relative amount of change is 
greatest at that point.  </p><p></p><p>  Second, sparklines seem to have
 characteristics of both one and two dimensional shapes.  Although 
fractals are no longer in vogue, applying those ideas might yield useful
 techniques.  Thus, choosing a fractional dimension too small, that is, 
too close to 1, might result in an display similar to the poor baseball 
W/L sparkline, while a dimension too large could result in the poor 
sunspot example.  This might help the representation of outliers as 
well.

		<p><i>Sparklines as a Windows TrueType Font</i>
</p><p> 
</p><p>Dear Prof. Tufte,</p>

<p>we implemented both Barsparks and dichotomous Sparks as a Windows TrueType Font (TTF). Typing
61023647679 gives you <img src="EdwardTufte_files/sparkfont_sample1_bars.gif" alt="Sparkfont: Bars" title="" border="0" height="9" width="41">,
and +/++-+++-++++//+ produces <img src="EdwardTufte_files/sparkfont_sample2_dicho.gif" alt="Sparkfont: Dichotomous" border="0" height="9" width="49">.
A TTF can be created easily, e. g. using graphical software like CorelDraw,
and it can be printed even in very small sizes.</p>

<p>Our font uses eleven characters ("." and the numbers 0 - 9) which differentiates in
about .5 mm steps when using a 12 pt font size. For dichotomous Sparks we use "+"
for upward whiskers (wins, in the baseball example), "-" for downward whiskers
(losses) and "/" for ties.</p>

</p><p>Nicolas,
Great idea. One thing, to expand on Niels' comment, is that the bar 
spark currently only allows for positive values. However, there are many
 instances where negative values are required and sometimes a mixture of
 positive and negative. In effect then, this would require three sets - 
all positive, all negative and a mixture. Is this relatively easy to do?
 I would disagree a little with Niels though, in that as this font is 
designed to be used just within text as one is writing, having accuracy 
to four significant digits would seem unnecessary, as this isn't what is
 designed to be shown with a bar spark.

</p><p>Sacrifice a significant digit and make the first one + or -: 
ctrl-+001, ctrl-+002, etc and ctrl--001, ctrl--002.... To use the full 
ascender and descender height of the line you would have to set the 
horizontal axis at something above the normal writing plane, sort of 
your x-height for the font. If the eye can only extract two significant

		<p><i>2004 Baltimore Orioles Run Differential Sparkline</i>

Here's my shot at David Rosen's suggestion.  Below is a run differential
 sparkline for the Baltimore Orioles 2004 season (data courtesy of 
ESPN.com).

</p><p>
Same conventions apply, but instead of adding the thin line along the 
middle to indicate home games, I added a gray shaded area that signifies
 winning/losing within 5 runs (an arbitrary number), and homestands.  
The little star indicates the All-Star Break, which for  the Orioles 
occurred after 85 games.

		<p><i>MS Office add-in to create sparklines from Windows TrueType Fonts (TTF)</i>
</p><p> 
</p><p>Following our previous posting about our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bissantz.de/sparklines/bissantz_sparkfont_10.html">first prototype</a> of a TrueType Font which can be used to enter
	bar-style Sparklines in e. g. Word documents, we received quite some positive feedback
	(thanks everyone!) and decided to carry on this idea.</p>
	
<p>Firstly, we refined the original font <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_fine.gif" alt="" border="0" height="12" width="69"> and created 100 characters so we can
	now differentiate positive values in steps of 1&nbsp;%. Note that the difference is hard
	to tell on the screen, but printouts are razor-sharp.</p>
	
<p>Secondly, we made up four additional fonts which have their zero line not on the bottom,
	but somewhere in the middle or on top of the characters. This allows for positive and
	negative values. Multiple fonts are needed to reflect different ratios between the
	largest positive and the largest negative number. This way we can make sparks like
	<img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_100.gif" alt="" border="0" height="11" width="34"> with all negative values, sparks with high negative and relatively low positive
	values <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_75.gif" alt="" border="0" height="15" width="52">, sparks whose (absolute)
	negative and positive values are similar <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_50.gif" alt="" border="0" height="15" width="53">
	and sparks with small negative and big positive values <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_25.gif" alt="" border="0" height="15" width="64">.</p>
	
<p>Thirdly, we included the dichotomous sparks for indicating wins, losses and ties, for
	example <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_bars_dicho.gif" alt="" height="15" width="70"> in soccer, tennis or baseballs matches.
	
</p><p>And finally, we tried to construct lines <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_line_dots.gif" alt="" border="0" height="12" width="94"> from
	specifically crafted characters that represent line segments. From the data set we
	want to visualize, we derive a grid of, say, 20 groups. Each data point in the set
	is assigned to one of the 20 groups, and each group is graphically represented as
	a dot. It is then possible to draw all the connections between any two points.
	These line segments can be combined and result in a line-style Sparkline, with
	 or without <img src="EdwardTufte_files/bsf_line_wo_dots.gif" alt="" border="0" height="10" width="55"> the points.</p>
	
<p>Since we now employ several hundred characters from our "Sparkfonts", we
	programmed "SparkMaker", a small add-in for Microsoft Office products.
	This tool is used to enter the data. It will calculate which fonts and which
	characters have to be used to get the matching Sparkline, and it will insert the
	ready-formatted Sparkline into your Word, Excel or PowerPoint document.</p>

<p>To evaluate, you can download the SparkMaker tool and the fonts from our web site:<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bissantz.de/sparklines">http://www.bissantz.de/sparklines</a></p>

		<p><i>Sparklines in Formula 1 racing </i>
</p><p> This is very nice.  I can't remember how I wound up reaching it,
but I'm glad I did!  Thanks, and I'm looking forward to the new book.
</p><p>
It gave me the idea to try something I wanted to see.  In Formula
1 racing it is always said that your biggest rival is your teammate
(because he's the only one with the same car). Sometimes they show
stats in tables so that you can see teammates compared, but I don't
remember seeing a graph.  So I tried to come up with something
to see what could be seen.  My first try is the following.
This shows the results for four pairs of teammates in the 1996 season:<br>
<img src="EdwardTufte_files/sparklinef196.png">
<br>
The drivers' names are on the left.  The gray bars are drawn to the
side of the driver that qualified ahead of his teammate and they are
all proportional to the difference in time using the same scale.
I think I was lucky in that, because probably there are times when
the result would be way out of proportion, and I don't know what
to do to handle that.  Maybe just adjust everything to a maximum
like 1 or 2 seconds?
</p><p>
The vertical lines on each side show when the driver finished and was
officially classified; the longer the line, the higher they finished.
If there is no line then the driver did not finish.  Since teammates often
finish very close to each other it was necessary to add color (green) to the
line for the highest-finishing driver; otherwise
it might not be easy to tell who finished ahead of whom.  I
sort of like having the color only when both finished, for some reason.
</p><p>
To show points scored in each race, I added horizontal red bars at the end
of each line. The width is proportional to the number of points scored.
When you get a win, the bar is the full width of the race in the graph,
so win streaks show up as solid bars (see Hill at the start of the season).
The end of the graph shows the season total of points for each driver.
</p><p>
So, these little graphs give
</p><ul>
<li>Who qualified ahead and by relatively how much in each race.
</li><li>Finishes and non-finishes in each race.
</li><li>Who finished ahead in each race, if both finished.
</li><li>Generally how many points earned in each race.
</li><li>Roughly how high up the driver(s) finished in each race.
</li><li>Wins and win streaks.
</li><li>Total season points.
</li></ul>
<p>
I was originally thinking about setting up a whole career in a line.
I do like the results so far, and I wonder if there are ways to improve them.
If I can get more data (I only have one old Autocourse book for 1996) then I could show
a whole career across one screen.  I was thinking that the driver in question
would be on top, and a colored line down the center of the x axis could match
up with a key to his teammates.  Each color would show a different teammate (and
maybe team) for a certain time period.

		<p><i>SparkTicker: an interactive ticker with sparklines for business data</i>
</p><p> 
</p><p>Reflecting on how to increase information density on computer screens, we've been
	investigating the combination of a moving ticker with sparklines. In our implementation,
	data can come from Excel, OLAP cubes, relational databases or realtime from web sources.
	The example shows Dow Jones quotes from 2005-02-16 to 2005-04-15.</p>

<table style="background: url('http://www.bissantz.de/sparklines/marquee-background.gif');" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="583">

</tbody></table>

<p>In the desktop version, we have made the ticker interactive, allowing users to access
	more detailed data through semantic zooming. Three zoom sizes award more screen real
	estate with more information (iMail = incoming emails).</p>

<p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/zoomsizes.png" alt="Sparklines in three zoomsizes" border="0" height="144" width="494"></p>

<p>A magnifying glass eases micro reading whenever necessary. Values are abbreviated following
	a set of rules which eliminate superfluous details.</p>
<p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/magglass.png" alt="Magnifying glass for sparklines" border="0" height="44" width="175"></p>	

<p>For business data we have introduced new sparkline types: The magnitude of deviations is
	shown as colored boxes on top or below the bars
	<img src="EdwardTufte_files/dev_spark.gif" alt="Deviation Spark" border="0" height="20" width="82">.
	Gaps differentiate this type from stacked bars.  In this other example
	<img src="EdwardTufte_files/share-spark2.gif" alt="Share Spark" border="0" height="20" width="64">,
	shares are represented by partially filled bars, whose overall height show the referred totals.
	Double bars show comparisons, e. g. to previous year's values <img src="EdwardTufte_files/comparison-spark3.png" alt="Comparison Spark" border="0" height="17" width="95">.
</p>

<p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/sparkline-on-mobile.png" alt="Sparkline on a cell phone" style="float: left;">Due to differing
	communication standards, another challenging issue for sparklines are cell phones.
	In order to get some feedback, we send current results of German premier league soccer every Sunday
	to the phones of a few dozen sports fanatics.</p>

Here is my interpretation of sparklines in a product I am working on - 
</p><p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/sparklines.htm"></p>
<p>I finally settled on vertical bars as the indicator of highs and lows because 
  it is difficult to get a dot to stand out at normal screen resolutions and if 
  you make the dots too big they drown out the sparkline. It also highlights stocks 
  that have multiple highs and lows (eg ARG and RIO) By placing the open and close 
  prices aligned with the ends of the sparkline eliminated the need for other 
  coloured dots and also gets around the problem of what happens when the high/low 
  is also the open/close.</p>

</p><p>In the opening example to the sparkline chapter, a gray band is used to signal normal

within the gray field.</p><p></p><p>This technique can be generalized in terms of "importance flags". Thus when something 
interesting happens in part of a sparkline, the area of interest can be indicated by a yellow

don't want to turn sparklines into vulgar stoplight charts (with their vivid red-yellow-green attitude).</p><p></p><p>The design theory for making signal flags is found in Envisioning Information, chapter 3

		<p><i>Combining sparklines with quartile plots</i>
</p><p> First or all, thanks to Tchad for the suggestion on where to 
post the images. I wanted to get some feedback on an idea for combining 
the ideas of a quartile plot (distribution in the same chart across 
multiple instruments) with sparklines. In financial markets, for 
example, the yield curve is observed as the maturity on the x-axis 
versus the interest rate on the y-axis. A quartile plot will show some 
information but frequently, one needs to be able also to put the 
information in an historical context.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious way 
in which to do this is by instead replacing the quartile plot with a 
sparkline. This preserves the relative interest rate at each maturity 
point while also giving more historical context. This can be shown 
either with or without the min max, as in the two examples below.</p><p></p><p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/43747598_ca41960163.jpg"></p><p></p><p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/43747597_e0ca80f6cf.jpg"></p><p></p><p>Anyone

</p><p>Thoughts on bivariate time-series:  We often plot parallel time 
series (in Will's case above do we have essentially 5 pairs?), with time
 on the x-axis and response on the y-axis.  Why not plot, as Will 
mentioned earlier, interest rate against yield for all the time points? 
 Then the interest-rate/yield relationship can be shown to shift as a 
function of time.  One of ET's books (I forget which one --- my copies 
have yet to be unpacked after the move) shows a number of plots of, I 
think, inflation and unemployment rate and how that relationship changes
 over time.</p><p></p><p>For Will's data, I envision 5 small multiples 
that show paths through the rate-by-yield space over time.  The current 
point can be highlighted, the minima and maxima can be shown and 
annotated on the axes, and temporal proximity to the present can be 
shown via shading (more recent data are more pronounced, older data are 
faded). "Same time last year" and "last month" or whenever, can be shown
 by a special symbol, perhaps an "M" for month or a "1" or "2" or 
whatever for 1 year ago and 2 years ago and so on.</p><p></p><p>If time 
IS the fundamental causal variable, then I'm not sure the dashed lines 
connecting the starting and ending points really add anything, except 
that the start points are growing faster (left to right) than are the 
endpoints, as shown by the diverging lines, although I'm not sure that 
comparison is of any value.  I guess I like the min and max values but 
not the connecting lines.     </p><p></p><p>Although my training is in 
time series, I always find the traditional time series plots 
academically unfulfilling, since, following the "the data display is the
 model" idea, they imply that the only thing driving the variability is 
time.  They seem more like reports of what has happened than tools for 
understanding the sources of variability in the data.  I find it more 
enlightening to plot y against x and let time snake the path around the 
x,y plane.</p><p></p><p>Let us all be cautious that the sparkline 
concept ("intense, simple, word-like graphics") doesn't get morphed into
 just "tiny time series plots".  It seems to me that the goal, with all 
our displays, ought to be getting as much data in front of the viewers' 
eyes as is feasible and to facilitate the comparison(s) of interest.  
Whether the plot is a time series or empirical cumulative distribution 
function or scatter-plot or whatever, taking advantage of 
high-resolution display media and small pictures right in the text is in
 the best interest of large rates of information transfer.  Galileo's 
drawings of the shape of Saturn are certainly not time series.  </p><p></p><p>Perhaps
 this is an open call for more "intense, simple, word-like graphics" 
that are NOT time series.  &lt;sound of the gauntlet dropping&gt;</p><p></p><p>

</p><p>In the context of interest rate markets, the connect-the-dot 
lines are very important, as this determines the interest rate one earns
 for investing for different periods of time. For example, investing 
over a 3Y period earns 7.55% per year but investing for 5Y earns 7.88%. 
The underlying tenor (1 to 5Y) does not vary but the amount being earned
 on each and the relationship between them does change. One of the most 
frequent questions asked within financial markets is how has each 
individual rate changed over time and how has the relationship between 
these rates changed over time. This is frequently plotted as a bivariate
 relationship, showing the yield on what instrument versus the yield 
differential between that instrument and another point on the curve. 
However, this makes it virtually impossible to discriminate sufficiently
 both between many points of the curve and also variability through 
time. Small multiples could be used but this would need to be more than 5
 small multiples (showing every combination would generate 10 charts). 
This also would miss valuable information contained in the current 
overall yield curve shape, which must be plotted as tenor versus 
interest rate.</p><p></p><p>My overall intention though was to extend on
 the usual quartile plot (min, 25%, median, 75%, max) across multiple 
instruments which actually contains relatively little information (not 
withstanding the cleaner version on page 125 of VDQI), while also giving
 information about the current yield curve shape. A potential addition 
could also be to highlight a particular intermediate yield curve shape, 
as chosen by the user, in order to illustrate how the curve shape has 
changed.

</p><p>Will,</p><p></p><p>Regarding the aspect ratio and average slope issues: it seems to me that the problem is 
that you have two trends that compete in trying to bank the data to 45 degrees. There is a 
low frequency baseline and there are higher frequency movements on top of that. This is 
similar to the monthly CO2 measurements from the Mauna Loa observatory discussed in 
William Cleveland's Visualizing Data. ET seems to want the high frequency component 
banked to 45 while the plot that I see seems to emphasize the baseline trend (roughly). </p><p></p><p>To offset this effect, you might try to fit the data to a linear baseline, subtract that, then 
bank the data, and, finally, add the baseline back in. The more sophisticated solution, 
given again by Cleveland, is to fit the data with lowess, smoothing over a large number of 
data points (alpha ~ 1, lambda=1); subtract this trend, bank the data, and add the smooth 
trend back in (or plot the baseline and high frequency separately, but I don't think this will 
work for your application). </p><p></p><p>Whether to  bank the baseline trend or the high frequency ``spikes'' is a matter of 
judgement. As always the proper visualization technique is very contextual to the data and 
cognitive task at hand. So, I thnk ET's advice "lumpy not spiky" is a bit glib. For the 
sunspot data, yes. But the Mauna Loa CO2 data teaches another lesson -- different trends 
in the data can compete for the optimal aspect ratio leaving both suboptimal. </p><p></p><p>So I will end my answer where I probably should have started it, with a question. Which 
component of the data do you want to emphasize, the high frequency component, the 
baseline trend, or both? To emphasize the baseline, fit the data to a smooth trend, bank 
that, and add the high frequency component back. To emphasize the high frequency 
component, bank it, not the baseline, after smoothing, and again merge the results. 
Finally, to emphasize both, bank each and plot them separately. IMHO.

		<p><i>Fractal/sparkline analogy?</i>
</p><p> Sparklines resemble fractals, in the sense that the form and 
visual texture of sparklines remain the same as the resolution scale 
changes. This is seen in the zoom-sketch of the data (63 months, 12 
months) for euro exchange rates in the second table and, particularly, 
in the illustration about half-way down page 8 in the essay at the top 
of the thread.
</p><p>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/000210-2317.jpg" border="0" height="78" width="500"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
The resolution of time-fractals of sparklines can exist in the data-base
 underlying the sparkline, as viewers zoom through years, months, days, 
hours, minutes, seconds, and so on. For data analysis, contextual zooms 
are preferred, as shown in the zoom on page 8. 
Contextual zooms enforce the micro-macro comparisons resulting from 
sparkline scale changes, and avoid the where-am-I-now effect of 
uncontextual zooms that erase the the previous scale version of the 
sparkline, as too often seen in scale changes when moving in and out of 
aerial photographs. In this scale shift, note the change in aspect 
ratio, a matter worth thinking about since the aspect ratio should be 
data-driven to some extent:
</p><p>

    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td><img src="EdwardTufte_files/000210-2318.jpg" border="0" height="103" width="252"></td>
      </tr>  
    </tbody></table>
</p><p>
Contextual zooming might be reported as in the big euro conversion table
 on page 8: a sequence of sparkline table entries at various 
time-scales. 
</p><p>
I hope a Kindly Contributor with a high-resolution database (years, 
months, week, days, hours, seconds . . .) can construct a good example 
moving through many orders of magnitude, perhaps following the 
architecture of the page 8 sketch. There is something of a Powers-of-Ten
 metaphor here as well, although the fractal metaphor still holds as 
each new image in the sequence remains a sparkline. This requires a big 
database underlying the time-series as required by the changing 
resolutions. 
</p><p>
Perhaps the fractal metaphor can mobilize some of the many elegant 
computer programs for displaying fractals, but now using great piles of 
empirical data rather than geometric modeling as the basis for depicting
 and driving images based on scale changes. Such evidence-based fractals
 would greatly extend the power of sparklines.
</p><p>
Regardless of the metaphor, contextual scale zooms are exactly what 
sparklines are good at: displaying intense amounts of data, now 
in-depth, not just as one fixed time-scale sitting there in still 
flatland. Of course, some dynamics can be added to each sparkline at 
each resolution as new data flows in, possibily in real-time.

see if the response of the system is liner, exponential, or step-like.  Clearly, if the

		<p><i>SAS macro for sparklines</i>
</p><p>Hello to Professor Tufte and All,
I have been following Professor Tufte's work since he first came to my 
attention about a year ago. I really like the simplicity and power of 
sparklines. Since I am a statistician, I use SAS in my daily work. So, I
 thought it would be useful to find a way to make sparklines in SAS from
 a SAS data set since there are many other statisticians out there using
 SAS. The more formats that the creation of sparklines are offered in, 
the more accepted they will become.</p><p></p><p>I have put together a 
SAS macro for PC SAS that allows the user to create sparklines by using a
 SAS data set with the data points arranged in one of the columns. The 
macro allows the user to select the trend or bar type of sparkline. 
Although I have been programming in SAS for over 8 years, I am not an 
expert in SAS/GRAPH, so any recommendations for improvements to the 
macro would be appreciated. Currently the user is restricted to 11 
characters for the descriptive word that appears to the right of the 
sparkline. The output appears in the SAS graph output Window. My 
recommendation is to right-click on the output, choose File&gt;Export As
 Image... and save the output as an image. I have been having good luck 
with PNG files. You will notice that the font appears rather large, as 
does the red dot representing the current value, but this is necessary 
so that when the file is reduced and put into a document, it looks 
right. Unfortunately there is one additional manual step: you need to 
open the PNG (or other picture format) file and cut out just the narrow 
sparkline portion to insert in a document.</p><p></p><p>Examples and the SAS code can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://home.mchsi.com/%7Emarchendel/sparklines.html">http://home.mchsi.com/~marchendel/sparklines.html</a>.

the bars got much thinner than they are right now, there was a real 
difficulty in getting the mouse pointer over the bar you wanted. In my 
experience, people aren't accurate with a mouse to within more than 
about 4 pixels. Besides, that's just about how fat the little finger is 
on the end of the hyperlink hand pointer! BTW, yes, this display can be 
adapted to just about any corpus.</blockquote>

<p>When working with the graph I would have to agree that the thickness 
of the bars is about the practical minimum. The user has to be able to 
pause the pointer over the desired bar for the tooltip pop-up to appear.</p>

<p>One nice touch that didn't get demonstrated in the previous 
screenshot is a yellow highlight that follows the mouse pointer and 
helps indicate which bar it's over.</p>

		<p><i>Red/green distinctions in data displays</i>
</p><p> </p><p>It was Nick Van Valkenburgh who referred to red-green 
colour blindness (on 6th March 2005). This is almost an insoluble 
problem once one decides to use colour at all, because people who can 
see red without difficulty tend to find it an excellent colour for 
having anything stand out from the rest, and such people are not only 
the large majority (much more than 90% I suspect: see below) but they 
also find it hard to imagine the difficulties that those in the minority
 have. One thing to remember is that in many contexts grey-scales work 
much better than colour-coding anyway, as our brains have built-in ways 
of ranking shades of grey that they don't have for different colours. 
(ET discusses this in one of his books: I forget which one, but it's at 
home, so I can't check.) Unfortunately I doubt if shades of grey are 
sufficient to make distinctions in anything as small as a sparkline, but
 one can experiment.

</p><p>The figure of 10% of males (not of people, for which the 
proportion is very unlikely to be more than 5%) is often quoted, but I 
believe it is misleading. There are many people (myself, for example) 
who would fail a test of red-green discrimination if they were applying 
for training to be fighter pilots, but that is a very stringent 
criterion and excludes a lot of people who by no means regard themselves
 as colour-blind for everyday activities, and who have no difficulty in 
seeing a red dot among a group of black ones. In any case, even if 
red-green colour blindness is the commonest form it is not the only one,
 and making things better for the red-green colour-blind may make them 
worse for others.

</p><p>As an anecdotal piece of evidence, about 25 years ago I was at a 
meeting where one participant, fully red-green colour-blind himself, 
complained at the use of red in early computer graphics for making 
things stand out. He asserted that about 10% of males were colour-blind,
 but although there were around 60 people present (mostly male) he was 
the <em>only</em> one who had any problems.

</p><p>Note that I am not saying that the problems are not real, or that
 we should make no effort to prevent them from arising, only that I 
believe that in practice they affect a lot fewer than 10% of people. 
Even if they only affect 1% of people we should take them seriously. As 
the user of a minority operating system (Macintosh), and user of a 
browser (iCab) that is used by a small minority of that minority, I am 
quite familiar with web sites that announce that they do not "support" 
the browser that I choose to use. No matter how small the minority 
affected adversely by a design decision we should always do our best to 
cater for it.

		<p><i>Red/green and other special interests</i>
</p><p>I liked ET's answer to the colorblindness issue at the end of the
 Skeptics Society lecture (and I seem to recall this from the one-day 
course): yielding design to one special interest group opens the 
designer to demands from every special interest group, of which he 
estimated there are about 20. Better to design well.</p><p></p><p>Personally,
 I'm left-handed. Driving, cameras, guns (I'm in the military, this is a
 serious problem), sissors, "ergonomic" mice, dining with someone else 
next to me (elbows), assymetrically bevelled knives (mainly found in 
kitchens), rulers, watches, hemostats (and I'm in medical school: watch 
out!), and many other medical instruments, but most of all, writing.</p><p></p><p>I'd
 like the English-speaking world to redesign the language to be read 
bottom-to-top, right-to-left, because sometimes my pinkie and the side 
of my palm pick up so much ink while writing that some of the letters, 
sometimes whole words become illegible (like when I'm taking notes in a 
one-day course with 300 other people). This happens more when it's warm 
(like in a full lecture hall) because of perspiration and the ink 
staying either soft or wet a bit longer, and I'm quite sure about ten 
percent of people are lefties (estimates range between 2 to 30 percent 
for either lefty or ambidexterous). So, alternatively, could we just 
move the planet a bit further from the sun? Or at least reverse global 
warming?

		<p><i>ET brief history of sparklines</i>
</p><p>I gave a talk at Google last December and emphasized sparklines 
by giving out a 4-
page technical report on sparklines at the beginning of the talk and 
then asking everyone to read it. After that, I worked my way through the
 report. My goal was to alert them to the idea of sparklines and then 
that they would envision all the wonderful possibilities (especially 
given their excellent sense of analytical design). I gave somewhat 
similar talks at Genentech and JPL on that trip.</p><p></p><p>Yahoo uses
 sparklines for some financial data. The Google financial graphics are 
competent but utterly conventional. (Maybe someone can post a sample 
page and also post a redesign combining tables and sparklines, thereby 
breaking free of  standalone graphics). A model for that might be the 
exchange-rate example in the draft chapter posted at the beginning of 
this thread.</p><p></p><p>One problem is that, at leading edge of really
 high-resolution sparklines, we need paper's 
resolution. Computer screens are OK but they don't operate at the 
intense resolutions
needed by sparklines at their best. Computer displays operate at about 
10%-15% of the resolution of paper, a performance level that doesn't 
matter that much for routine analysis but does matter for serious, 
high-resolution visual data analysis.</p><p></p><p>I had hoped that the 
New York Times in their revisions of the mutual fund and stock market 
tables would take advantage of paper's resolution and build in the daily
 sparkline histories for a year of each of the 800 or so mutual funds on
 a single page of newspaper. (I sent an early draft of the sparklines 
material to the paper's design director a couple of years ago.) The idea
 is to exploit paper's comparative advantage, high resolution, over the 
computer screen. That might be one way for newspapers to survive, for a 
while, internet news. On a Times mutual-fund tables page, for example, 
sparklines would put 400,000 additional prices and changes in prices on 
each printed page of the market table, and make those tables just 
sparkle. Readers would soon discover that there are not 800 different 
funds on that page but probably only about 25 or 43 or something like 
that, since many funds share roughly identical day-to-day price shifts 
for a full year--as we saw in the top 10 mutual funds example in the 
Beautiful Evidence chapter draft on sparklines presented at the 
beginning of the thread. Mutual fund comparisons are more complicated 
than that, but the daily year-long comparative price paths are a good 
start.</p><p></p><p>My first sparkline sketches were made some 15 years 
ago when I reviewed an HP medical interface for monitoring hospital 
patients (which involved, I recall, a Unix box for every ICU patient, or
 maybe a Unix box on a cart wheeled around the hospital). The idea was 
to put sparklines on the margin of a big spreadsheet recording all 
patient data (event by time), thereby summarizing  the time-series 
history of each event category. My conclusion was that the medical staff
 would rarely look at the original spreadsheet and would instead just 
look down the column of sparklines showing the events time-series. And 
then the original medical event spreadsheet could then be down-screen if
 a user wanted details.

</p><p>David Flanagan asks above whether it's best to use anti-aliasing

Professor Tufte frequently points out that monitors have poor resolution
 compared to printers. </p><p></p><p>This prompts me to ask, has anyone 
implemented sparklines for display on monitors that use so-called 
sub-pixel resolution techniques?  This is the practice of improving the 
appearance of fine lines or edges by taking advantage of the fact that a
 colour "pixel" on a monitor is really three physically-separated 
elements, each a different colour. Microsoft has used this technology in
 its ClearType fonts, but I haven't heard of it being used for graphical

<i>The New York Times</i> sports section on June 23, 2006 displayed a 
sparkline-like graph showing the outcomes of the last 218 basketball 
games of the New York Knicks. As our scale of measurement shows, the 
graph is 12 in (30 cm); a real sparkline would be a little over 2 in (5 
cm).
</p><p>
The graph is nicely integrated with surrounding text, numbers, and 
images. The whiskers showing wins are too light compared to the whiskers
 showing losses. The win-whisker blue-tint is also used as a background 
tint immediately above, an unnecessary congruence. Wins might be shown 
in red not pale blue. The instructions for reading the sparkline "Below,
 each tick mark represents a victory or loss..." are not needed 
especially since the two rows of ticks are labelled "victories" and 
"losses". (Why not "wins" rather the "victories"? Perhaps because "wins"
 is both a verb and a noun.) Those labels are not needed; every reader 
of the sports page will know what the whiskers mean. After all the 
reader is expected to understand these fancy words in the reports 
accompanying the graph:&nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>sycophantic &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  perpetuity &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;  passive-aggressive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  tenure 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  enigma &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  pariah 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dysfunctional</i>
</p><p>
Both the column and the news story psychologize about the personalities 
of those in the team bureaucracy rather than the performances of 
basketball players and their competition, both of which might have 
something to do with the team performance. Of course not every column or
 news story need fully account for all the sources of variance, but 
these stories seem a bit one-sided in their mode of analysis.</p><p>
The graphic reporter is not credited for her or his good work, although 
the columnist, reporter, and photographer are. Publicly acknowledged 
creatorship signals responsibility for work and also often improves the 
quality of work.

</p><p> The problem with congressional votes is that their content and relevance needs to be at 
least briefly 
described with some text accompanying the vote. <i>The Washington Post</i> bill 
numbers 
and vote descriptions are mysterious except to insiders; and sparkline histories also don't 
catch 
content and relevance. Perhaps a better way would be to identify the 20 most important 
votes in 
a session and then talk about the voting distributions.</p><p>There are all sorts of vote 
ratings made by various political 
groups that serve better than the <i>WP</i> list and sparklines. </p><p>I always enjoy 
seeing 
sparklines but this application should have more text describing each vote, or perhaps 
different 
binary categories. </p><p> The <i>WP</i> breakdown by astrological sign shows what 
randomness can produce in the way of pseudo relationships, and so in its somewhat silly 
and prankish way shows what vote distributions look like under the null hypothesis. That 
might calm down the rage to conclude when studying other cross-tabs of votes. </p><p>

There is a substantial literature in political science using multi-dimensional scaling to 
coax some more complex and richer meanings out of voting records (House, Senate, 
Supreme Court) compared to univariate marches through the votes. Although even here 
remains a problem of separating out the key votes from the many trivial votes taken in the 
House. There are probably ways to derive importance weights for votes. And also various 
consent rules are used to mask votes; for example, there was no vote by name on the 
House "pizza rule" on few years ago, where lobbyists could supply pizza to members of 
Congress on the floor, or something like that.

scales from 0 to the max of all quotes, yet it is useless because most

that highlight companies that had above normal volume of dollars traded 
on the NYSE/Nasdaq.  I used the Google Charts API to render the graphs, 
which made my job much easier.  The sparklines add context to understand
 why a company is on a given report and if a spike in dollars traded is 
on the first day of some breaking news, coming down from a previous 
peak, or enjoying a longer term trend.  It also gives the user the 
ability to visually filter for the kind of trends they like to follow 
the most.  I believe it has made the previously text-only data tables a

		<p><i>Sparklines useful for USGS streamflows</i>
</p><p> </p><p>Sparklines could help protect life and property if they were used to present the USGS online data for 
streamflows. The current presentation is dismal. For example, find a gauge for a river near you on the USGS’ 
page of <a target="_blank" href="http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt">Daily Streamflow Conditions</a>. 
Click through to the individual page for that gauge, and generally you will see this information (some pages show 
more data; others, less):</p>
<ul>
<li>a plot of streamflows (or “discharge”) recorded over the last 7 days (you can extend the range to 
as much as the last 31 days, but that does not change the main point of this argument)</li>
<li>a table showing this summary information <em>for the current date</em>:
<ul>
<li>the lowest flow on record</li>
<li>the 20th-percentile flow</li>
<li>mean flow</li>
<li>median flow</li>
<li>most recent instantaneous flow recorded (today)</li>
<li>the 80th-percentile flow</li>
<li>the highest flow on record</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a plot of gauge heights recorded over the last 7 days</li>
<li>a table of summary information, similar to that described above for streamflow, for gauge heights <em>on the 
current date</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing? <strong>Perspective.</strong> For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the stream is near flood stage, the corresponding value will appear on the respective plots, but otherwise 
there is usually no indication of how far above or below flood stage today’s flow is.</li>
<li>There’s no information for the flood of record or for any other historic benchmarks not recorded on the 
currrent date. A rancher can tell whether the stream is high for today, but not whether it’s <em>even close 
to</em> the level it reached when it drowned his livestock 30 months ago.</li>
<li>Realistic ranges of values are often absent. The highest and lowest values shown on each plot depend on the 
values recorded over the last 7 days. If there has been little change, the full vertical range of values displayed may 
represent only an inch of difference in gauge height, for example. But the height of the display is the same, 
regardless of whether that range is 0.01 foot or 100 feet. So trivial changes are exaggerated, and historic changes 
are minimized.</li>
<li>You can see how gauge height varied with streamflow over the last 7 days, but not how it <em>will</em> 
respond to values outside that range: Will the additional 3000 cfs coming downstream raise this stream an inch or 
12 
feet when it gets to this gauge?</li>
<li>For that matter, the wealth of information available about seasonal behavior of this stream is absent. When is it 
typically low? And how low is that, typically?</li>
</ul>
<p>A spark chart would show all of the above and more. It would be particularly useful when flooding occurs 
outside of the typical flood season—for example, when heavy rains fall in usually bone-dry July, how does 
the flooding produced compare to the typical spring floods? Will it merely call for a change in plans for the weekend, 
or will it pose a great danger to lives and property? In fact, it was just such an event a little over five years ago that 
led me to propose to the local USGS office that they use spark charts to display this information.</p>
<p>So far, no response.</p>

		<p><i>Bivariate financial performance matrix</i>
</p><p>In looking at financial time series, one of the challenges is to 
be able to analyse a very large number of bivariate relationships. Some 
of this can be achieved by statistical measures but visualisation of the
 relationships typically has a significantly positive impact. In the 
attached image, I've attempted to do this (with inspiration attributable
 to Cleveland) by plotting these bivariate relationships in a matrix. As
 this analysis is time series analysis, and given that the relationships
 are symmetrical, I have split the two halves of the matrix into the 
top-right showing the bivariate x-y plot (the different format 
datapoints are to highlight different periods of time, with more recent 
data darker and the latest datapoint shown as red with a callout), and 
the bottom left showing the time series of the difference between the 
two series (for those who are interested, the series being plotted are 
of credit default swap indices, ranked from lowest to highest average 
spread down the rows with the exception of the two emerging market 
indices in the top-left - I work in Emerging Markets). The diagonal then
 shows the time series of each individual index. I would be curious to 
know if anyone has any feedback or suggestions on how this could be 
improved.</p><p><img src="EdwardTufte_files/0003Cs-8047.GIF" height="824" width="779"><br clear="all">

</p><p>Will Oswald's Cross-Credit Historical Relationships matrix is 
wonderful.  Always a fan of these "you are here" plots, I love the black
 dots against the grey past-values distribution and the red current 
value.  We can see the current data in relation to the past.  Beautiful 
layering.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps what is most instructive is how the 
simple times series don't tell the whole story as they are only marginal
 distribution summaries; Will has shown us the joint distirbution, 
which, as is typical, tells a richer story.</p><p></p><p>Compare the 
data for the third and fourth entries (NA.IG and NA.IG.HVOL) to the data
 for the sixth and seventh entries (NA.HY B and NA.HY).  Looking just at
 the time series, the third and fourth entries look mildly similar: 
flat, then big bump, then rise-to-peak, then fall.  The difference plot 
shows that the differences go flat, then attenuated bump, then rising 
bumps.  The joint distribution shows a really tight relationship, as 
evidenced by the points so close to the line.</p><p></p><p>Now look at 
the sixth and seventh. The time series look very similar: small rise 
then fall, then bump, then bigger rise then fall.  The difference plot 
isn't particularly special but the scatter plot of the joint 
distribution shows that the recent data are completely different from 
what has happened in the past: all but one of the black dots is 
completely removed from the other points!</p><p></p><p>Well done, Will.</p><p></p><p>Rafe

</p><p> We put easy-to-use sparklines on the iphone in a new app called 
TraxStocks.  These can do some of what is requested above.    A posting 
in a different thread on this site got us some helpful feedback a few 
months ago.
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=328195811&amp;mt=8">Link to TraxStocks at the appstore</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>The things that make this app different than many of the other stock apps out there are 
</p><p>1) Sparklines
</p><p>2) Allowing comparisons.  You can drag the top sparkline around 
the screen over any other sparkline.  OR, you can put several items 
together a single graph if you turn your iphone or ipod touch on its 
side.  The images I've attached show only two stocks, but you can have 
up to 10 on the graphs in landscape mode, and there's no limit to the 
number of sparklines in the portrait mode.
</p><p>3) Elimination of chart junk.  Almost all all "non-data ink" has 
been erased. There are a few exceptions that seemed to provide a needed 
visual boundaries.
</p><p>4) Swiping through time
</p><p>5) The ability to look broadly at trends, and immediately get 
specific data for specific dates by just touching the screen at that 
spot.  A bubble pops up showing the date and value.  
</p><p>
</p><p>We welcome more feedback -- especially from readers here.  These 
displays could be used for nearly any data over time, but we started 
with financial data. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Thanks.

"Sparktweets" on Twitter as happily described by Jason Kottke at <a target="_blank" href="http://kottke.org/11/05/twitter-" sparklines="">http://kottke.org/11/05/twitter-sparklines</a>

Skepticism about sparktweets from Than Tibbets at <a target="_blank" href="http://thanland.com/notes/regarding-those-" sparktweets="">http://thanland.com/notes/regarding-those-sparktweets/</a>
</b></p><p><b>
Than Tibbets rightly criticizes the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> sparktweets, but perhaps some sparktweets can be 
rescued.
</b></p><p><b>
My view: if you're doing Twitter, then sparktweets is about all you can do in regard to data graphics. So now and then a 
sparktweet will be better than nothing, but that's all it's better than (which is a short summary of Twitter in general, 
although is it amazing what now and then can be done in one 140-character sentence). Sparktweets are awfully low 
resolution and easily prone to data distortion. The solution: every sparktweet should be accompanied by the beginning 
and the ending number in the time sequence (which burns up 6 to 8 characters toward the 140 maximum, but with a 
great increase in data-presentation integrity). Sparktweets don't measure up to real sparklines, however.
</b></p><p><b>
A few of the examples shown by Jason Kottke have decent resolution. For example, this clever baseball win/loss 
summary by Stu Spivack (which alas has to fold the last 7 games onto the third and fourth lines):

</p><p> One of the convenient things about the Twitter-style sparklines 
is that as Unicode text, they work everywhere text does. So you can 
write a command-line generator for them: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/holman/spark">github.com/holman/spark</a>
<br>
And then you can pipe in data from the rest of the command-line ecosystem. I like the earthquake example myself:
<br>
</p><pre> curl http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/catalogs/eqs1day-M1.txt --silent | 
  sed '1d' |
  cut -d, -f9 |
  spark
<span style="font-size:0.7em">&#9605;&#9606;&#9602;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9605;&#9602;&#9602;&#9605;&#9607;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9603;&#9606;&#9606;&#9606;&#9605;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9601;&#9602;&#9602;&#9606;&#9601;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9603;&#9602;&#9606;&#9602;&#9602;&#9602;&#9601;&#9602;&#9602;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9603;&#9602;&#9602;&#9601;&#9602;&#9602;&#9605;&#9602;&#9602;&#9606;&#9606;&#9605;&#9603;&#9606;</span>

More useful, graphing Beijing air quality:

 for a paper testing the ability of students to use sparklines to detect
 patterns and anomalies in financial report data. The examples integrate
 semimonthly sparklines into conventional income statements, thus 
providing 25 times the original number of data points, albeit at low 
resolution. The students were able to use the sparklines to answer 
fairly complex questions, with no prior training in sparklines. The 
paper will be published in the February issue of International Journal 
of Accounting Information Systems.

		<p><i>Axes in sparklines</i>
</p><p> </p><p>Almost every sparkline I've seen has omitted the x-axis, and for the good reason that the lower limit is rarely zero. 
However for one case I'm dealing with (fraud statistics), an important fact to illustrate is how close to zero the fraud 
level gets. So what I ended up with was something like:</p>

<p><strong>Counterfeit fraud</strong> <img src="EdwardTufte_files/apacs-spark-Counterfeit.png" alt="Counterfeit" class="aligncenter 
size-full wp-image-5098" style="vertical-align: middle" height="21" width="56">&nbsp;<span style="color: red">(??42.1m)</span></p>

<p>I also included a y-axis, to allow comparison to data where there are missing elements, e.g.:</p>

<p><strong>Telephone banking fraud</strong> <img src="EdwardTufte_files/apacs-spark-Phone.png" alt="Telephone banking" title="Telephone banking" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5118" style="vertical-align: middle" height="21" width="56">&nbsp;<span style="color: 
red">(??39.6m)</span></p>

<p>The horizontal scale of each sparkline is the same, but the vertical scale is from zero to the maximum value of the 
data. I would have preferred to use the same vertical scale, but due to one value being about ten times as much as 
others, it would result in most other graphs dragging along the x-axis.</p>

<p>The grey rectangle on the left indicates a period of time which is of interest (the deployment of a new anti-fraud 
mechanism), matching the full size chart, which 
can be seen in context in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2013/03/13/uk-bank-fraud-up/">blog 
post where I used these sparklines</a>.</p>

<p>I've tried to make the axes as unobtrusive as possible, and I do think they add important information for this data 
set, but I'd appreciate other opinions on this matter.</p>

		<p>The New York Times graphics team has (again) used sparklines effectively in a couple of 
recent graphics. There may be more, but I noticed these two.</p><p></p><p>The first is part of the explanatory text for a terrific graphic by Mike Bostock, Shan 
Carter, and Kevin Quealy that shows the history of college football conference alignments. 
The rest of the graphic is so compelling and engrossing that the sparkline may be easy to 
miss.
(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/11/30/football-conferences/">http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/11/30/football-conferences/</a>)</p><p></p><p>The second is part of the home page for The Upshot. The header includes a small section that 
shows, with both text and a sparkline, which party is projected to win the Senate according 
to the Upshot's forecasting model. This nice touch is also, apparently, the work of Mike 
Bostock and Shan Carter. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/">http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/</a>)</p><p></p><p>In both cases, the sparklines are used beautifully as ET originally conceived them: "a small 
intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution."
